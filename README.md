# CSS Flexbox and Grid

This application serves as a demonstration of Grid and Flexbox, two key CSS styling concepts that are essential for setting up webpage layouts. We'll be consulting `basics.html` and `basics.css`, which are in our `basics` folder, throughout this README - for more advanced examples, you can check out the files in the `flex` and `grid` folders. There is also an assessment at the end of this README - to complete that, you'll use the files in the `assessment` folder.

## Assessment
This is a challenge assessment to help you understand the concepts of CSS Flexbox and Grid. You will be asked to modify a simple CSS file that will be used to style a simple HTML file. Initially, both the flex and grid container divs are not quite right. They look something like this:

![HTML page before any changes](./images/before.png)

Using your knowledge of CSS Flexbox and Grid, modify the CSS file to make the flex and grid container divs look like the following:

![HTML page after changes](./images/after.png)

Remember that there are many ways to solve this challenge. The only requirement is that you modify the CSS file to make the flex and grid container divs look like the second image. After completing this challenge, you will be able to:
- Use CSS Flexbox and Grid
- Use CSS Flexbox and Grid to create simple layouts
- Use CSS Flexbox and Grid to make complicated layouts more manageable

Switch to the "possible-solution" branch after completing the challenge to see a possible solution.
